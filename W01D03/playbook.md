## 4.6- looping over objects

- Go over 04.6-startercode-looping-objects.js

    - add new key value pairs to an object
    - update an existing key value pair
    - variables go in bracket notation, literal property names go in dot notation or bracket notation with quotes
  - for in loop to loop over objects

  - for of loop to loop over arrays
