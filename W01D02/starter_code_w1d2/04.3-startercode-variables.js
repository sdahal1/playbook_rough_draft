// var -> don't use it anymore

// declare variables using 'let' and 'const'

// const is only for variables you don't want to be able to reassign

// using const with arrays (push, pop, update at an index)


// using const with objects ()


// Using let in for loops
/* 
MAIN TAKEAWAYS:

1. Use const primarily; this will be your go-to. Moving forward, you'll want to declare most of your variables using const.

2. Use let if you need to reassign a value. This is a common requirement during for loops and sometimes with if statements.

3. Don't use var unless necessary, like when working in a codebase that uses it. However, that will likely only happen in the distant future. As mentioned above, there are other reasons to use (and to not use) var, but those will be covered in a different lesson. For now, just avoid it.
