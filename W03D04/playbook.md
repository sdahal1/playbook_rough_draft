## Module 14 - Making requests

### 14.2 - How the web works
- Client is the end user (browser, phone, etc;)
- Client is the web accessing device or software that request information (discord)
- Server is a program that receives requests and responds to them
- Request response cycle-> DNS looks up the ip address from a domain name
- Client makes many requests to the server to get information (html, css, js)


### 14.3- Postman
  - Show the constellations server, mention they will be using this for many of the assignments for this week
  - Postman download and usage-> show crypto api, pokemon api, thinkful.com, localhost:5000/constellations
### 14.4- Headers-> use postman for this
  - HTTP request methods-> get, post, put, delete
  - Show the routes for the constellations from platform
  - Get all constellations, get one constellation with an id
  - Delete constellation with an id
  - Post a new constellation-> request body is raw json
  - Other headers-> for authorization, etc-> they will be presented later in the course when we need them
### 14.5- Requests in Javascript->
  - Show them how to have two servers running at the same time
  - Use 14-making-requests/src/14.5 startercode to: show all players-> use console.logs and run using node
  - Show additional examples for the functions: getAllPlayerNames, getPlayersByState


### 14.7-Making Requests Assessment
  - Use 14-making-requests/src/14.7 startercode to-> show all players, create a player, find a player by id, delete a player, update a player

### 14.6-Testing asynchronous Javascript
  - Walk through the platform because often students are confused about the reading here
